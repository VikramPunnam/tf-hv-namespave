Hi Nathan,

Could we onboard HEHV to AAP to facilitate job scheduling for log rotation on the Vault servers via the AAP platform?

I have some experience with writing and managing configuration management using Ansible, and I’d be happy to contribute by creating Ansible automation scripts.

Subject: Discussion on Vault Log Rotation

Hi [Recipient's Name],

I spoke with Nathan about automating tasks for ControlPlane (e.g., patching, log rotation, upgrades, etc.) and considered utilizing the Ansible platform for this purpose. He recommended reaching out to you specifically regarding the log rotation.

Would it be possible to have a quick discussion about this when you have a moment?

Best regards,

Thank you, Santhosh and Hemanth, for your support and for helping clarify the processes.

Thanks, Scott, for assisting with the Luna client installation on the Vault servers.

Great interactions with Nathan and valuable knowledge sharing.


CR Description:

This change updates the log rotation configuration for Vault audit logs. Instead of rotating logs monthly, the new configuration will rotate the log file when it reaches 20GB in size. This ensures better log management based on file size rather than a fixed time interval.



Using log rotation based on a size threshold instead of a fixed time interval ensures efficient disk space management, prevents excessive log growth, and optimizes system performance by reducing unnecessary file operations. It adapts to varying log volumes, making it ideal for high-traffic environments while avoiding unnecessary rotations during low activity. This approach also improves log

The choice between size and maxsize in logrotate depends on your specific use case:

size: Ensures log rotation happens when the file exceeds the specified size, but rotation only occurs during the scheduled logrotate run (e.g., daily, weekly). If the file reaches the limit before the next run, it won't rotate immediately.

maxsize: Forces an immediate rotation once the log exceeds the specified size, regardless of the logrotate schedule.


Which One is Best?

Use size if you want logs to be checked and rotated on a scheduled basis.

Use maxsize if you want real-time log rotation as soon as the file grows beyond a threshold.


If you need both scheduled and real-time rotation, you can combine them. For example:

size 100M
maxsize 200M

This ensures logs rotate at 100MB during the scheduled run but will also rotate immediately if they reach 200MB before the next scheduled run.


logrotation:
Implementing this change ensures efficient log management by rotating logs based on size rather than a fixed schedule, preventing disk overutilization and optimizing performance. It enables real-time log rotation, reduces unnecessary rotations, and provides better log retention control. If not implemented, logs may grow uncontrollably, leading to potential disk space issues, service disruptions, inefficient log rotation, inconsistent log management, and increased manual intervention. This change helps maintain system stability and reduces administrative overhead.

This change needs to be deployed to ensure that Vault logs are rotated efficiently based on size rather than a fixed schedule. Deploying this change prevents potential disk space issues caused by rapid log growth, which could impact system performance and availability. Without this deployment, logs may not rotate in time, leading to increased disk usage and potential service disruptions. Since the change has been tested successfully in the UAT environment, moving it to production will help maintain system stability and ensure consistent log management.



Here’s a well-framed update:

Subject: Update on Prisma APIs Migration to Vault

Hi Team,

Here’s the latest update on the Prisma APIs migration to Vault:

1. Connected with Taye and his team to review the architecture diagram. They are still working on the Python script development.


2. Gained access to Harness Dev and created a sample pipeline for the Python script (for testing purposes only) under the app-dctrn project.


3. In dev-vault, created a KV path for Prisma, set up a role inside approle, and provided the Role ID and Secret to Taye’s team for testing. Buchi from their team confirmed they were able to generate the token successfully, and it is working as expected in the Python script.


4. Today, Taye scheduled a call to discuss the next steps and further understanding.



Going forward, my focus will be on pipeline creation and addressing Vault-side requirements.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
[Your Name]
