Hi Nathan,

Could we onboard HEHV to AAP to facilitate job scheduling for log rotation on the Vault servers via the AAP platform?

I have some experience with writing and managing configuration management using Ansible, and I’d be happy to contribute by creating Ansible automation scripts.

Subject: Discussion on Vault Log Rotation

Hi [Recipient's Name],

I spoke with Nathan about automating tasks for ControlPlane (e.g., patching, log rotation, upgrades, etc.) and considered utilizing the Ansible platform for this purpose. He recommended reaching out to you specifically regarding the log rotation.

Would it be possible to have a quick discussion about this when you have a moment?

Best regards,

Thanks, Scott, for assisting with the Luna client installation on the Vault servers.

Great interactions with Nathan and valuable knowledge sharing.


CR Description:

This change updates the log rotation configuration for Vault audit logs. Instead of rotating logs monthly, the new configuration will rotate the log file when it reaches 20GB in size. This ensures better log management based on file size rather than a fixed time interval.



Using log rotation based on a size threshold instead of a fixed time interval ensures efficient disk space management, prevents excessive log growth, and optimizes system performance by reducing unnecessary file operations. It adapts to varying log volumes, making it ideal for high-traffic environments while avoiding unnecessary rotations during low activity. This approach also improves log

The choice between size and maxsize in logrotate depends on your specific use case:

size: Ensures log rotation happens when the file exceeds the specified size, but rotation only occurs during the scheduled logrotate run (e.g., daily, weekly). If the file reaches the limit before the next run, it won't rotate immediately.

maxsize: Forces an immediate rotation once the log exceeds the specified size, regardless of the logrotate schedule.


Which One is Best?

Use size if you want logs to be checked and rotated on a scheduled basis.

Use maxsize if you want real-time log rotation as soon as the file grows beyond a threshold.


If you need both scheduled and real-time rotation, you can combine them. For example:

size 100M
maxsize 200M

This ensures logs rotate at 100MB during the scheduled run but will also rotate immediately if they reach 200MB before the next scheduled run.


logrotation:
Implementing this change ensures efficient log management by rotating logs based on size rather than a fixed schedule, preventing disk overutilization and optimizing performance. It enables real-time log rotation, reduces unnecessary rotations, and provides better log retention control. If not implemented, logs may grow uncontrollably, leading to potential disk space issues, service disruptions, inefficient log rotation, inconsistent log management, and increased manual intervention. This change helps maintain system stability and reduces administrative overhead.

This change needs to be deployed to ensure that Vault logs are rotated efficiently based on size rather than a fixed schedule. Deploying this change prevents potential disk space issues caused by rapid log growth, which could impact system performance and availability. Without this deployment, logs may not rotate in time, leading to increased disk usage and potential service disruptions. Since the change has been tested successfully in the UAT environment, moving it to production will help maintain system stability and ensure consistent log management.

Subject: Update on Prisma APIs Migration to Vault

Hi Team,

Here’s the latest update on the Prisma APIs migration to Vault:

1. Connected with Taye and his team to review the architecture diagram. They are still working on the Python script development.


2. Gained access to Harness Dev and created a sample pipeline for the Python script (for testing purposes only) under the app-dctrn project.


3. In dev-vault, created a KV path for Prisma, set up a role inside approle, and provided the Role ID and Secret to Taye’s team for testing. Buchi from their team confirmed they were able to generate the token successfully, and it is working as expected in the Python script.


4. Today, Taye scheduled a call to discuss the next steps and further understanding.



Going forward, my focus will be on pipeline creation and addressing Vault-side requirements.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
[Your Name]

I have a question regarding Vault authentication from Harness.

There are multiple authentication methods available, including using connectors and the secret manager. If we choose the connector approach, should I create a new connector and configure it, or can we use an existing one? Please let me know.

If the subname can be any alphanumeric value but must be followed by an underscore and exactly six digits, you can use the following Terraform variable validation:

variable "resource_name" {
  description = "Resource name must follow the pattern <subname>_123456, where <subname> is alphanumeric and followed by an underscore and exactly six digits."
  type        = string

  validation {
    condition     = can(regex("^[a-zA-Z0-9]+_\\d{6}$", var.resource_name))
    error_message = "The resource_name must be in the format <subname>_123456, where <subname> is alphanumeric and followed by exactly six digits."
  }
}

Explanation:

^[a-zA-Z0-9]+ → Allows any alphanumeric characters as subname

_ → Requires an underscore after subname

\d{6}$ → Ensures exactly six digits at the end

The can(regex(...)) function validates the format and returns an error if it does not match.


This will ensure that subname_123456 format is followed while allowing different alphanumeric values for subname.




variable "app_id" {
  description = "Application ID"
  type        = string
  default     = null

  validation {
    condition     = var.crownjewel ? (var.app_id != null && var.app_id != "") : true
    error_message = "app_id must be provided if crownjewel is true."
  }
}


Terraform does not allow a variable's validation condition to reference other variables directly (like var.crownjewel). However, you can work around this limitation by using a precondition in a module or by handling validation in a separate resource.

Solution 1: Use precondition in locals (Terraform 1.2+)

If you're using Terraform 1.2 or later, you can use a precondition within locals:

variable "crownjewel" {
  description = "Flag to determine if app_id should be used"
  type        = bool
}

variable "app_id" {
  description = "Application ID"
  type        = string
  default     = null
}

locals {
  selected_app_id = var.crownjewel ? var.app_id : null

  # Validation using a precondition
  validation_check = {
    precondition = !(var.crownjewel && (var.app_id == null || var.app_id == ""))
    error_message = "app_id must be provided when crownjewel is true."
  }
}


---

Solution 2: Validate using a Terraform null_resource

If you're using an older Terraform version, you can use a null_resource with a lifecycle rule:

resource "null_resource" "validate_app_id" {
  count = var.crownjewel && (var.app_id == null || var.app_id == "") ? 1 : 0

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo 'Error: app_id must be provided when crownjewel is true.' && exit 1"
  }
}

If crownjewel is true but app_id is missing, Terraform will fail during execution.


---

Solution 3: Handle in terraform.tfvars

Instead of enforcing it in Terraform code, you can document it and handle it through input validation in CI/CD pipelines or manual checks.

Would any of these approaches work for your case?



You're right—the precondition inside locals won't work because Terraform's locals block does not support validation. Instead, you should use Terraform's built-in validation rules correctly.


---

Correct Approach: Using validation for app_id

Since Terraform does not allow referencing other variables in a variable validation block, you cannot directly validate app_id based on crownjewel within variable blocks. However, you can enforce the check using a null_resource trick or precondition in a module (Terraform 1.2+).


---

Solution 1: null_resource for Validation

This method forces Terraform to fail if crownjewel is true but app_id is missing.

variable "crownjewel" {
  description = "Flag to determine if app_id should be used"
  type        = bool
}

variable "app_id" {
  description = "Application ID"
  type        = string
  default     = null
}

# Validation using a null_resource
resource "null_resource" "validate_app_id" {
  count = var.crownjewel && (var.app_id == null || var.app_id == "") ? 1 : 0

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo 'Error: app_id must be provided when crownjewel is true.' && exit 1"
  }
}

How it works:

If crownjewel is true and app_id is empty or null, Terraform fails with an error.

Otherwise, Terraform proceeds normally.



---

Solution 2: precondition in a Module (Terraform 1.2+)

If you're using Terraform 1.2 or later, you can enforce validation in a module's precondition block.

module "app_config" {
  source      = "./modules/app"
  crownjewel  = var.crownjewel
  app_id      = var.app_id

  depends_on = [null_resource.validate_app_id]
}

locals {
  selected_app_id = var.crownjewel ? var.app_id : null
}

output "app_id" {
  value = local.selected_app_id
  precondition {
    condition     = !(var.crownjewel && (var.app_id == null || var.app_id == ""))
    error_message = "app_id must be provided when crownjewel is true."
  }
}

How it works:

The precondition ensures app_id is mandatory when crownjewel is true.

This method only works in Terraform 1.2+.



---

Solution 3: Document the Requirement & Handle in CI/CD

If you can't use Terraform 1.2+ or don't want to use null_resource, you can document the requirement and enforce it in a CI/CD pipeline with a simple script:

if [ "$TF_VAR_crownjewel" = "true" ] && [ -z "$TF_VAR_app_id" ]; then
  echo "Error: app_id must be set when crownjewel is true."
  exit 1
fi


---

Conclusion

✅ Terraform 1.2+? → Use precondition inside a module or output block.

✅ Older Terraform? → Use a null_resource to enforce validation.

✅ No code enforcement? → Handle validation in CI/CD pipelines.


Would you like help structuring this inside a Terraform module?





The error "app_id is required but no definition was found" happens because the app_id variable is not passed into the module and does not have a default value inside the module's variables.tf file.


---

Solution: Provide a Default Value for app_id in the Module

If you want Terraform to not require app_id when it's not passed, add a default value in the module.

Fix: Add a Default Value in modules/app/variables.tf

variable "app_id" {
  description = "Application ID"
  type        = string
  default     = null  # This allows the variable to be optional
}

Now, if app_id is not passed, Terraform won't throw an error.

The default value (null) will be used instead.



---

Alternative: Ensure app_id is Passed from terraform.tfvars

If app_id is defined in terraform.tfvars but not explicitly referenced in the module block, Terraform will not pass it into the module automatically. To fix this, explicitly pass app_id in the module:

Fix: Pass app_id in the module Block

module "example" {
  source     = "./modules/app"
  crownjewel = var.crownjewel
  app_id     = var.app_id  # Explicitly pass the variable
}

Now, Terraform will pass app_id from terraform.tfvars to the module.

Subject: Update on Prisma API Keys Migration to Vault

Hi Team,

Here are the latest updates on the Prisma API keys migration to Vault:

1. I’ve updated the pipeline.yaml configuration in Harness to fetch secrets directly from Vault without using native Harness secrets.


2. Received the Python script from the Prisma team and integrated it into the pipeline.yaml file to generate secrets on the fly and pass them to the Python script. This has been tested successfully along with Babu from the Prisma team.


3. Mohan and I joined a call with the Prisma team and provided a demo of the basic pipeline functionality, which meets the team’s requirements. The demo was presented to Taye, Jason Buck, and their team.


4. During the call, we discussed multiple use cases, including Jenkins integration.



Please let me know if you have any questions or need further details.

Best regards,

This keeps it short, clear, and professional. Let me know if you’d like me to tweak it!

Hi Mohan,
Good morning.

I’d like to have a 10-minute discussion with you regarding the Docker image build process within the WF (open-source/in-house).

We’re currently working on a POC for secret management in OCP and will need to deploy components on the OCP.

Could you please share your availability?

curl --header "X-Vault-Token: <YOUR_VAULT_TOKEN>" \
     --request POST \
     --data '{"data": {"ca_crt": "'"$(cat /path/to/ca.crt | base64)"'"}}' \
     https://<YOUR_VAULT_SERVER>:8200/v1/secret/data/ca-cert



Subject: Clarification on Service Account Token Creation for Vault CSI Provider

Dear HashiCorp Support Team,

We have observed that when deploying the Vault CSI Provider using the Helm chart, a Kubernetes service account is created, but a corresponding service account token is not automatically generated.

To work around this, we manually created a service account token by generating a Kubernetes secret of type token. This token (token_reviewer_jwt) is then used to configure the Vault Kubernetes authentication method.

Could you please confirm if it is the user's responsibility to create and manage the service account tokens in this case?

Looking forward to your guidance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Known Issue: Escaping Special Characters in Vault Key-Value Strings

Problem

When storing key-value pairs in Vault, special characters in string values may cause parsing issues. This can lead to incorrect data interpretation or retrieval errors.

Resolution

To properly escape special characters in a Vault key-value string, enclose the value in escaped double quotes. Specifically:

Add \" at the beginning of the string.

Add \" at the end of the string.


Example (JSON Format)

{
  "Key": "\"value\""
}

By following this approach, Vault correctly interprets and retrieves the stored string value.



Known Issue: Escaping Special Characters in Vault Key-Value Strings

Problem

When storing key-value pairs in Vault, values that contain special characters (such as spaces, quotes, or escape sequences) may not be processed correctly. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as:

Vault failing to parse the JSON payload correctly.

The application retrieving improperly formatted values.

Issues with consuming the values in scripts or environment variables.


To avoid these issues, special characters must be properly escaped within the Vault key-value store.

Root Cause

Vault expects JSON-formatted data when storing secrets, and JSON requires that string values be enclosed in double quotes (" "). If a value itself contains double quotes, they must be escaped properly to ensure correct interpretation by both Vault and any applications retrieving the secret.

Resolution

To correctly store a string value that includes special characters, follow these steps:

1. Enclose the value in escaped double quotes (\" at the beginning and \" at the end).


2. Ensure the JSON payload follows Vault's expected format.



Example (Correct JSON Format for Vault)

{
  "Key": "\"value\""
}

In this example:

The actual stored value will be "value", including the double quotes around value.

This ensures that Vault correctly interprets and retrieves the value without errors.


Example: Writing the Secret to Vault Using cURL

When writing this key-value pair to Vault via the CLI or API, the escaping must be maintained:

curl --header "X-Vault-Token: <TOKEN>" \
     --request POST \
     --data '{"data": {"Key": "\"value\""}}' \
     http://<VAULT_ADDRESS>/v1/secret/data/myapp

Example: Retrieving the Secret from Vault

After storing the secret, retrieving it using vault kv get or curl will return the properly formatted output:

{
  "data": {
    "data": {
      "Key": "\"value\""
    }
  }
}

Impact if Not Escaped Properly

Incorrect Parsing: Vault may not correctly interpret the value, leading to errors when storing or retrieving the secret.

Unexpected Behavior in Applications: If an application reads an improperly formatted string, it may fail to process it correctly.

Potential Security Issues: Misinterpreted secrets could cause unexpected application failures or incorrect authentication behavior.


By ensuring correct escaping, Vault users can avoid these common pitfalls and maintain consistency in stored secrets.



Hello,

Just an FYI:
We encountered an issue today related to special characters in strings when storing them in Vault. The issue has been resolved.

I have documented the issue and its resolution in our HEHV Vault known issues.

I got online, and by the time I logged in, the Vault server had unsealed itself without any action on my part. Shortly after I checked, I received this email confirming that the alert status was clear.



kubectl get configmap kube-root-ca.crt -n default -o jsonpath="{.data.ca\.crt}" > ca.crt


Successfully completed a Proof of Concept (PoC) to integrate HashiCorp Vault with OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) using two approaches: the Vault CSI provider and the Vault Agent injector. The Vault CSI provider was evaluated for its ability to inject secrets into application pods via file mounts, supporting automatic updates and improved isolation. The Vault Agent injector was also tested for secret injection via sidecar containers, offering templating and environment variable support. Both approaches were validated for functionality, security, and compatibility with OCP workloads. The PoC outcomes are under review to finalize the most effective and maintainable integration method for production use.

Additionally, the Vault audit log rotation configuration was enhanced to improve log management and operational efficiency. The previous time-based monthly rotation policy was replaced with a size-based strategy, allowing logs to rotate automatically once they reach a specified file size. This change helps prevent large log files, ensures timely log archival, and optimizes disk space usage. It also improves observability and compliance readiness by aligning log rotation with actual system activity rather than fixed intervals.
