Hi Nathan,

Could we onboard HEHV to AAP to facilitate job scheduling for log rotation on the Vault servers via the AAP platform?

I have some experience with writing and managing configuration management using Ansible, and Iâ€™d be happy to contribute by creating Ansible automation scripts.

Subject: Discussion on Vault Log Rotation

Hi [Recipient's Name],

I spoke with Nathan about automating tasks for ControlPlane (e.g., patching, log rotation, upgrades, etc.) and considered utilizing the Ansible platform for this purpose. He recommended reaching out to you specifically regarding the log rotation.

Would it be possible to have a quick discussion about this when you have a moment?

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Thank you, Santhosh and Hemanth, for your support and for helping clarify the processes.

Thanks, Scott, for assisting with the Luna client installation on the Vault servers.

Great interactions with Nathan and valuable knowledge sharing.


CR Description:

This change updates the log rotation configuration for Vault audit logs. Instead of rotating logs monthly, the new configuration will rotate the log file when it reaches 20GB in size. This ensures better log management based on file size rather than a fixed time interval.
