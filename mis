🔐 Vault Agent Injector Integration Guide for Applications

This guide helps application teams integrate their OpenShift workloads with HashiCorp Vault using the Vault Agent Injector. It provides the steps needed to securely retrieve secrets during both startup and runtime, without hardcoding credentials.


---

📌 1. Overview

To securely manage sensitive application secrets (e.g., database credentials, API keys), your application must use the Vault Agent Sidecar Injector. This method ensures secrets are retrieved at runtime and are not stored in code or static config files.

Vault Agent Injector:

Injects a Vault Agent container (sidecar) into your pod.

Authenticates to Vault using Kubernetes Service Account JWT.

Fetches secrets and writes them as environment variables or files.

Optionally supports auto-refresh for secrets like DB credentials.



---

🛠️ 2. Prerequisites

Before onboarding, your application must be:

Deployed on the OpenShift Container Platform (OCP).

Associated with a Kubernetes Service Account that your pod uses.


You’ll need to provide the following to the Vault team:

OCP Project/Namespace

Service Account name

Intended Vault secret path(s) (e.g., kv/data/myapp/config)

Type of secret usage: file, environment variable, or config



---

🚀 3. Vault Onboarding Process

Once the Vault team receives your details:

1. A Vault role will be created, bound to your service account and namespace.


2. Appropriate Vault policies will be created/granted to allow your app to read the required secrets.


3. You’ll receive a sample deployment.yaml with the correct Vault Injector annotations.


4. You apply these annotations in your deployment manifest.




---

⚙️ 4. How the Vault Injector Works

Step-by-Step Flow:

1. When your pod starts, the Vault Injector webhook injects a Vault Agent as a sidecar container.


2. The Vault Agent uses the pod’s Service Account JWT token to authenticate with Vault.


3. If successful, Vault returns a token scoped with permissions for secret access.


4. Vault Agent retrieves the secrets and renders them:

As files in /vault/secrets/

OR as environment variables (via template rendering)



5. Your application reads the secrets from the expected location at startup or runtime.

🧾 5. Sample Deployment with Vault Annotations

Here’s an example Kubernetes deployment that uses the Vault Agent Injector to fetch secrets:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-secure-app
  namespace: my-namespace
  annotations:
    vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject: "true"
    vault.hashicorp.com/role: "my-app-role"
    vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-config.txt: "kv/data/myapp/config"
    vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-template-config.txt: |
      {{- with secret "kv/data/myapp/config" -}}
      DB_USER={{ .Data.data.username }}
      DB_PASS={{ .Data.data.password }}
      {{- end }}
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-secure-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-secure-app
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: my-app-sa
      containers:
        - name: app
          image: myregistry/myapp:latest
          env:
            - name: CONFIG_PATH
              value: /vault/secrets/config.txt

💡 Secrets will be written to /vault/secrets/config.txt inside the container.

✅ 6. Application Team Checklist

Before Vault onboarding begins, make sure:

[ ] Your app is deployed on OCP.

[ ] You’ve created a service account for your app pod.

[ ] You’ve identified the secret paths in Vault needed by the app.

[ ] You know how the app will consume secrets (file or env).

[ ] You’re ready to add Vault annotations in your deployment spec.



---

🧠 7. Best Practices

✅ Never hardcode credentials in the app or CI/CD pipeline.

✅ Keep Vault roles and policies scoped to least privilege.

✅ Use short-lived secrets with auto-renew or rotation (where applicable).

✅ Store secrets in the Vault KV engine, versioned if needed.

✅ Keep audit logs of access and usage.

❓ 8. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Q: What happens if Vault is temporarily unavailable?
A: Vault Agent caches the token and secrets locally, so secrets remain accessible until expiry. Plan for retry logic.

Q: Can I rotate my secrets automatically?
A: Yes, Vault supports dynamic secret backends (e.g., for databases). Contact the Vault team to set this up.

Q: How do I verify that the secrets are injected?
A: Exec into the pod and check /vault/secrets/ or log output from the Vault Agent.

Q: Do I need to restart my app to get updated secrets?
A: Vault Agent can be configured to reload secrets and notify apps. You'll need to integrate a signal handler or reloader process in your app.
