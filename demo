🎙️ Full Narration Script — Automated Certificate Management Demo


---

👋 Introduction

“Good morning everyone.
Today, I’ll be presenting our solution for Automated Certificate Management for OpenShift applications, using Cert-Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Venafi, and Istio.

The goal of this demo is to show how we’ve automated the entire lifecycle of TLS certificates — from issuance to renewal — without any manual steps, while maintaining complete security, compliance, and policy control.”


---

🚨 Problem Statement

“In most traditional setups, certificate management is handled manually.
Developers or operations teams raise certificate requests, wait for approvals, download the issued certificates, and manually configure them in their applications.

This approach leads to three major challenges:

1. Expired certificates causing unexpected outages,


2. Slow turnaround time due to manual approvals, and


3. No centralized visibility or control over certificate usage.



We wanted to solve all of this by introducing automation, consistency, and centralized governance — fully integrated with our enterprise Certificate Authority.”


---

⚙️ Solution Overview

“Our solution brings together four key components:

Cert-Manager, which automates certificate requests and renewals inside OpenShift.

Vault, which acts as a secure intermediary for authentication, authorization, and policy enforcement.

Venafi, which is our enterprise Certificate Authority and policy engine.

Istio, which consumes these certificates for TLS termination and mutual TLS inside the mesh.


Together, these components automate end-to-end certificate management in a secure, policy-driven way — with zero manual effort.”


---

💡 Value Addition

“This automation provides clear business and operational benefits:

1. Zero downtime — Certificates are renewed automatically before expiry, preventing outages.


2. Operational efficiency — No more manual certificate requests or approvals. Everything is handled by Cert-Manager and Vault.


3. Strong governance — Vault and Venafi enforce policy boundaries and log every request for full traceability and compliance.



Overall, it’s a secure, scalable, and compliant way to manage certificates across all applications.”


---

🏗️ Architecture and Flow

“Let me explain how the workflow operates end-to-end:

1. An application running on OpenShift defines a Certificate custom resource using Cert-Manager for its domain.


2. Cert-Manager detects the resource and generates a Certificate Signing Request (CSR).


3. The CSR is sent to Vault through a configured ClusterIssuer.


4. Vault authenticates the application’s Kubernetes service account and validates the request against defined Vault policies.


5. Once approved, Vault forwards the CSR to Venafi, which signs it according to enterprise zone policies.


6. The signed certificate is sent back to Vault, then to Cert-Manager.


7. Cert-Manager stores the issued certificate and key in a Kubernetes Secret.


8. Finally, Istio Gateway or OpenShift Route consumes this secret for TLS termination or mTLS communication.



All these steps happen automatically — including renewals — with no manual involvement at any stage.”

💻 Demo – Test Case 1: Certificate Issuance

“Now, let’s move to the first test case — certificate issuance.

Here, I’ve created a Certificate custom resource for the domain demo-app.example.com.
This certificate references a Vault ClusterIssuer, which connects to Vault for certificate signing.

When I apply this resource, Cert-Manager immediately creates a CSR and sends it to Vault.
Vault authenticates using the Kubernetes service account, checks its policy to ensure it’s allowed to request from the approved path, and forwards the request to Venafi.

Venafi signs the certificate as per the enterprise zone configuration and sends it back through Vault to Cert-Manager.
Cert-Manager then stores the signed certificate and private key in a Kubernetes Secret named demo-app-tls.

Now, Istio Gateway automatically picks up this secret for HTTPS termination.
To verify, I’ll run an OpenSSL command to confirm that the certificate is valid and issued by our Venafi CA.

This completes the automated certificate issuance workflow.”


---

🔁 Demo – Test Case 2: Automatic Renewal

“In the second test case, I’ll show how renewal happens automatically.

I’ll modify the certificate’s renewBefore field to a smaller duration to trigger early renewal.
Cert-Manager immediately detects that the certificate is nearing expiry and re-initiates the same workflow —
Vault authenticates → checks policy → forwards CSR to Venafi → Venafi signs → Cert-Manager updates the Kubernetes Secret.

Within seconds, the certificate is renewed and the same secret is updated with the new certificate.
Istio continues to use it seamlessly — there’s no downtime, no manual work, and no application restart required.

This demonstrates that our setup fully automates both issuance and renewal.”


---

✅ Conclusion

“To summarize —
We have implemented a fully automated, secure, and policy-controlled certificate management solution for OpenShift workloads.

Cert-Manager automates the entire lifecycle.

Vault enforces authentication and policy.

Venafi ensures CA compliance and enterprise governance.

Istio consumes the certificates for secure communication and TLS termination.


This eliminates manual intervention, reduces operational risk, and ensures compliance with enterprise security standards.

Our next step is to scale this solution across more applications and track the reduction in manual renewals and certificate-related incidents.

Thank you.”
