Slide 2: What is Containerization?
Packages apps with all dependencies

Consistent across different environments

Fast, lightweight, and isolated

Common tools: Docker, Podman

Slide 3: Introduction to Kubernetes
Open-source container orchestration tool

Automates deployment, scaling, and management

Works across clusters of physical or virtual machines

Supports various container runtimes (Docker, containerd)

Slide 4: How Kubernetes and Containers Work Together
Containers: Run application workloads

Kubernetes:

Deploys and scales containers

Monitors health and maintains state

Provides networking, discovery, and load balancing

Key components:

Pod, Node, Control Plane, Kubelet

Slide 5: Architecture Overview (Visual Slide)
(Use a diagram here with Control Plane connected to Node 1 and Node 2. Each node contains Pods.)

Control Plane: Manages cluster state

Nodes: Run app workloads (pods)

Pods: Smallest unit of deployment

Slide 6: Benefits of Kubernetes & Containerization
Automated scaling and self-healing

Rolling updates with no downtime

Resource-efficient and cost-effective

Microservices and CI/CD friendly

Cloud-native and portable

Slide 7: Containerization vs Virtualization

Feature	Containerization	Virtualization
OS Kernel	Shared with host	Full OS per VM
Startup Time	Seconds	Minutes
Resource Usage	Lightweight	Heavier
Use Case	Microservices, DevOps	Legacy apps, full isolation
Examples	Docker, Podman	VMware, VirtualBox
Slide 8: Summary
Containers simplify deployment and boost agility

Kubernetes orchestrates and manages containers at scale

Together, they enable modern, scalable, and portable applications

Ideal for microservices, CI/CD, and hybrid cloud strategies
