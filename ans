Subject: Milestone Achieved â€“ Automated Vault Control Plane Setup Across All Environments

Hi Team,

I am excited to announce that the HashiCorp Vault control plane has been successfully automated and deployed across all four environments (Sandbox, Non-Prod, Pre-Prod, and Prod) covering 160 servers using Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) workflow templates.


---

Business Impact

Achieved ~93% reduction in engineering time, allowing the team to focus on higher-value initiatives.

Standardized and automated the deployment process, improving operational efficiency, consistency, and security posture.

Established a scalable and repeatable automation framework, enabling faster rollout to future data centers.

Strengthened the foundation for application onboarding, accelerating adoption of secure secrets management across the enterprise.

Key Achievements through AAP Automation

All critical tasks were fully automated through Ansible playbooks integrated into AAP workflows, ensuring consistency and repeatability:

1. Pre-Cluster Validations â€“ Automated readiness checks for system prerequisites, network, and configuration.


2. Luna HSM Integration â€“ Automated CSR generation, Venafi certificate requests, installation, HA group creation, and member/standby setup.


3. Vault Binary & Licensing â€“ Automated retrieval of binaries from Artifactory, license from Ansible Vault, and secure directory setup.


4. Certificate Management via Venafi â€“ Automated request, retrieval, and deployment of 32 TLS certificates across all four environments.


5. Vault Service Configuration & Initialization â€“ Automated service configuration, archival of configs, and cluster initialization with secure handling of root and recovery keys.


6. Post-Deployment Validations â€“ Automated checks for Vault service health, seal/unseal state, and leader election across every node.

Why This Milestone Matters

Security & Compliance: HSM integration and Venafi certificate lifecycle automated end-to-end.

Reliability: HA configuration validated across all clusters with consistent leader/standby setup.

Efficiency & Speed: Entire setup reduced to a single automated workflow with minimal manual intervention.

Scalability: Proven automation framework ready for future data centers and application onboarding.

This is a critical step forward in building a robust Vault platform for our next-generation data centers. The next milestones will focus on platform hardening, DR readiness, observability, and application onboarding to fully operationalize Vault as our enterprise secrets management solution.

Thank you for your support as we continue this journey.

Would you like me to also prepare a PowerPoint-style summary (2â€“3 slides) that you can share with leadership, highlighting the business impact and automation achievements visually?
