Subject: Inquiry on Cluster-Wide Sidecar-less Secret Injection with Vault Injector

Dear HashiCorp Support Team,

We are currently exploring options for implementing sidecar-less secret injection using HashiCorp Vault, specifically with the goal of leveraging only an init container during application startup to inject secrets.

As part of our initial testing, we have validated the vault.hashicorp.com/agent-pre-populate-only annotation at the individual deployment level. This approach successfully enables secret injection during bootup without running a long-lived sidecar. However, this configuration applies only at the application deployment specification level.

We would like to understand if there is a way to configure this behavior at the cluster level—possibly through the Vault Agent Injector or any global configuration—so that all workloads follow the sidecar-less pattern by default without the need to explicitly set annotations in every deployment.

Could you please advise if this is currently supported or if there are any recommended approaches to achieve this cluster-wide behavior?

Looking forward to your guidance.

Best regards,
Vikram Punnam
