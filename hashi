Dear [Engineer’s Name],

Thank you for your response.

We would like to request that this issue be looked into on an urgent basis, as it is currently affecting our production pipelines. We are encountering intermittent context deadline exceeded errors when generating dynamic SPN credentials via the Azure Secrets Engine. These delays are resulting in credential validation failures and causing downstream pipeline disruptions.

We have also observed the same issue occurring in a second customer environment. To avoid further escalations and potential impact across additional environments and customers, we request your immediate attention to this matter.
