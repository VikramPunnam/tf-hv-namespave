Thank you for the clarification. Here's the revised formal version:

"Monika and I were able to dedicate some time today to implement certificate generation and retrieval using the Vault PKI engine via the sidecar agent approach. The solution has been tested and validated, and it is functioning as expected. I would be glad to present our progress to you tomorrow, should you have the time."
