Here's a detailed structure and content for a Confluence page documenting Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) concepts. This is designed to be clear, comprehensive, and easy to expand or maintain. You can directly copy-paste and format it in Confluence using headings, panels, and bullet points where needed.

🧩 Ansible Automation Platform – Key Concepts and Components

📄 Purpose

This document provides an overview of core components in Ansible Automation Platform (AAP). It is intended to help users understand how different elements interact and how to structure automation content effectively in AAP.


---

🏛️ 1. Organization

🔹 Description

An Organization in AAP is a logical grouping that helps segregate users, teams, credentials, inventories, and projects.

🔹 Key Points

Each organization can manage its own resources.

Access control and RBAC can be managed at the organization level.

Typically used to separate business units or environments (e.g., Dev, QA, Prod).



---

📦 2. Project

🔹 Description

A Project refers to the source of automation content such as playbooks, roles, or collections. This content is usually stored in a version control system (like Git).

🔹 Supported SCM Types

Git

Subversion (SVN)

Manual (local upload)


🔹 Best Practices

Organize playbooks by use case or environment.

Use a directory structure that supports reusability.

Link with automation controller via Git URL and credentials.



---

🧭 3. Inventory

🔹 Description

An Inventory defines the list of target systems (hosts or groups of hosts) on which the automation tasks will be run.

🔹 Types of Inventory

Static Inventory: Manually entered list of hosts.

Dynamic Inventory: Pulls host data from a source (like AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.).


🔹 Key Concepts

Can be grouped (e.g., web, db, prod, dev).

Variables can be assigned at host or group level.



---

🧑‍💻 4. Hosts

🔹 Description

Hosts are individual target machines listed in an inventory. Playbooks and jobs are executed on these machines.

🔹 Key Properties

Hostname or IP

Associated variables (e.g., ansible_user, ansible_port)

Group membership



---

🔐 5. Credentials

🔹 Description

Credentials provide secure access to remote systems, SCM, or cloud services.

🔹 Types of Credentials

Machine: SSH username and password/key.

Source Control: GitHub token or SSH key.

Vault: To decrypt Ansible Vault-encrypted files.

Cloud Provider: AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.


🔹 Best Practices

Use credential types appropriate for the service.

Store sensitive credentials securely.

Link credentials to job templates and projects.



---

⚙️ 6. Job Template

🔹 Description

A Job Template defines how automation content (playbooks) should be run — with which inventory, credentials, and extra variables.

🔹 Key Fields

Name, Description

Project & Playbook

Inventory

Credentials

Job Tags / Skip Tags

Verbosity level

Limit (subset of hosts)


🔹 Use Cases

Run playbooks for provisioning, patching, application deployment, etc.

Parameterize execution with extra vars or prompts.



---

🔁 7. Workflow Template

🔹 Description

A Workflow Job Template allows you to chain multiple job templates and control the execution flow (sequential, conditional, parallel).

🔹 Features

Graphical drag-and-drop interface

Success/failure conditions

Nested workflows

Manual approval gates


🔹 Use Cases

CI/CD pipelines

Infrastructure deployment followed by validation

Rolling updates with pre-checks and post-tasks



---

🛠️ 8. Execution Environment (EE)

🔹 Description

Execution Environments are container images that include the required dependencies, collections, and Python modules needed to run playbooks.

🔹 Key Concepts

Replaces legacy Python venvs

Can be managed using ansible-builder

Helps ensure consistent execution across environments



---

📚 9. Templates vs Workflows – When to Use What?

Feature	Job Template	Workflow Template

Runs a single playbook	✅	❌
Chains multiple playbooks	❌	✅
Conditional logic	❌	✅
Approval gates	❌	✅



---

🔐 10. Access Control & RBAC

🔹 Description

AAP allows fine-grained role-based access control (RBAC) to manage who can access and modify specific components.

🔹 Common Roles

Admin

Execute

Read

Update


🔹 Best Practices

Use teams for grouping users.

Apply roles at the lowest required scope (project, inventory, etc.).
