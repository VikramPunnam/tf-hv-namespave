Why Vault Injector Should Be Highly Available:

It's needed to inject Vault config/secrets into pods at creation.

If it's down, new pods won't get secrets, causing failures.

Existing pods are unaffected, but deployments and scaling can fail.

High availability ensures secret injection works cluster-wide without disruption.


The Vault Agent Injector is responsible for mutating pods at creation time to inject Vault Agent containers or configurations (e.g., init/sidecar containers or volume mounts for secrets).


The Vault Injector should be highly available because it is critical for initializing pods with Vault-based secrets. While it doesnâ€™t affect already running pods, it becomes a single point of failure for any new or scaling pods if not highly available.
