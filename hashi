Subject: On-call Availability During Upcoming Holiday

Hi Team,

I will be on-call during the period from [start date] to [end date].
However, please note that there is a local holiday in India (Hyderabad) on [holiday date].

During this day, I will still be available to attend Everbridge calls if needed, but I may not be able to actively monitor or respond to emails and incidents.

Please plan accordingly, and feel free to reach out in advance if anything requires my attention before the holiday.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
