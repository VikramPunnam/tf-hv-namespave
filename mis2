Before Vault onboarding can begin, your application must first be onboarded to OpenShift Container Platform (OCP). The application team is responsible for providing the following:

✅ OCP Project/Namespace

✅ Kubernetes Service Account associated with the application pod


Please ensure these are created and deployed as part of the application’s initial setup in OCP.

> 🔧 Coordinate with your internal OCP team to complete this step.
