Project: [CICD Team’s Jira Project]
Issue Type: Task (or Story — depending on your team’s process)
Summary: Setup CICD Pipeline for Sample Python Application with Container Image Build and OCP Deployment

Description:
We have a repository containing a sample Python application. The goal of this task is to understand the end-to-end CICD process — specifically focusing on:

Building a container image for the application.

Deploying the containerized application on the OpenShift Container Platform (OCP).


Scope of Work:

1. Container Image Build:

Set up the pipeline to build a container image from the Python application repo.

Ensure proper versioning and tagging of the image.

Push the image to the appropriate container registry.



2. Deployment to OCP:

Create and configure necessary OCP resources (like Deployment, Service, Route).

Deploy the containerized application on the OCP platform.

Validate that the application is running and accessible.



3. Documentation:

Document the steps involved in setting up this pipeline.

Outline any configurations, permissions, or tools required.




Acceptance Criteria:

A fully functioning CICD pipeline for container image build and OCP deployment.

Successfully deployed Python application accessible via OCP route.

Clear and comprehensive documentation provided.

In Vault’s Kubernetes authentication method, the "token reviewer JWT" is a crucial component used to verify the identity of a service account in a Kubernetes cluster. Let’s break down what it does and why it’s needed.

What is the Token Reviewer JWT?
The JWT (JSON Web Token) in this context is a token associated with a Kubernetes service account. When a pod wants to authenticate to Vault, it uses this service account token. Vault then needs a way to verify that this token is valid and was issued by Kubernetes — this is where the "token reviewer JWT" comes in.

Purpose of the Token Reviewer JWT:
Vault uses the token reviewer JWT to call the Kubernetes TokenReview API. This API verifies whether the service account token presented by the pod is valid and associated with the expected service account in the Kubernetes cluster.

How it works:

1. A pod in the Kubernetes cluster makes a request to Vault using its service account JWT.


2. Vault takes that JWT and checks its authenticity by sending a request to Kubernetes’s TokenReview API.


3. Vault uses the Token Reviewer JWT to authenticate to the TokenReview API.


4. Kubernetes verifies the pod’s service account token and sends back a response confirming whether it is valid and which service account it’s linked to.


5. If everything checks out, Vault allows the pod to access the resources it’s authorized for.
