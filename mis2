Before Vault onboarding can begin, your application must first be onboarded to OpenShift Container Platform (OCP). The application team is responsible for providing the following:

âœ… OCP Project/Namespace

âœ… Kubernetes Service Account associated with the application pod


Please ensure these are created and deployed as part of the applicationâ€™s initial setup in OCP.

> ğŸ”§ Coordinate with your internal OCP team to complete this step.
