Issue Type: Task (or Story — depending on your team’s process)
Summary: Setup CICD Pipeline for Sample Python Application with Container Image Build and OCP Deployment

Description:
We have a repository containing a sample Python application. The goal of this task is to understand the end-to-end CICD process — specifically focusing on:

Building a container image for the application.

Deploying the containerized application on the OpenShift Container Platform (OCP).


Scope of Work:

1. Container Image Build:

Set up the pipeline to build a container image from the Python application repo.

Ensure proper versioning and tagging of the image.

Push the image to the appropriate container registry.



2. Deployment to OCP:

Create and configure necessary OCP resources (like Deployment, Service, Route).

Deploy the containerized application on the OCP platform.

Validate that the application is running and accessible.



3. Documentation:

Document the steps involved in setting up this pipeline.

Outline any configurations, permissions, or tools required.




Acceptance Criteria:

A fully functioning CICD pipeline for container image build and OCP deployment.

Successfully deployed Python application accessible via OCP route.

Clear and comprehensive documentation provided.
