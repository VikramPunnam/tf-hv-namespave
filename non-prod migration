Here's a detailed explanation you can use to update your Confluence page, describing how to selectively migrate secrets and applications from one Vault Enterprise cluster to another using Performance Replication, along with an explanation of why this cannot be done using Terraform.

Vault Enterprise: Selective Data Migration Using Performance Replication

Background

When managing large-scale secrets infrastructure in HashiCorp Vault Enterprise, there may arise a need to migrate specific secrets, applications, or organizational units (e.g., team-specific paths or secret engines) from one Vault cluster to another. This is often required during:

Organizational restructuring

Cluster lifecycle upgrades

Regional/zone-level workload isolation

Cloud platform migration

Security boundary enforcement


Vault Enterprise provides a native and secure way to facilitate such migrations via Performance Replication with Mount Filters.

Why Terraform Cannot Be Used for Vault Data Migration

While Terraform is often used to manage Vault configuration (such as enabling auth methods, defining policies, creating secret engines, etc.), it is not suitable for migrating existing Vault data, for several reasons:

Terraform is declarative: It manages resources based on a desired state and does not dynamically discover or transfer existing secrets from one cluster to another.

Terraform is not designed for data export/import: It cannot recursively read, store, and replay secrets from one Vault to another.

Handling of sensitive data: Secret values read during a Terraform plan/apply cycle may be exposed in state files, violating best practices around secret management.

No built-in support for identity or lease migration: Entities, groups, leases, tokens, and their metadata are not handled by the Vault Terraform provider.


As a result, Terraform is best used for infrastructure as code within a single Vault cluster but not for cross-cluster data migrations.

Recommended Approach: Vault Enterprise Performance Replication

Vault Enterprise offers Performance Replication, which enables real-time or near-real-time replication of secrets from a primary cluster to one or more secondary clusters. When combined with mount filters, this feature can be used to replicate only specific parts of the Vault data.

Key Features of Performance Replication

Replicates KV secrets, database credentials, transit keys, and other secret engine data.

Replicates authentication methods and identity groups if configured within included mounts.

Supports multiple secondaries, allowing for a multi-cluster topology.

Allows filtered, selective replication, perfect for partial migrations.



---

Selective Migration via Mount Filters

Instead of replicating the entire Vault cluster (as DR Replication does), mount filters allow the administrator to specify exact paths or secret engines to include in the replication process. This enables precise, controlled migration of only the required data and applications.

For example, consider the following filtered mounts:

secret/team-a/*: Secrets for Team A

kv/app-123/*: Secrets related to application 123

transit/team-x: A dedicated transit engine for Team X


By applying these filters, only these specified mounts will be replicated to the secondary Vault cluster.


---

How the Process Works (High-Level)

1. Performance Replication is enabled on the primary Vault cluster.


2. A secondary token is generated to allow the target Vault cluster to securely connect to the primary.


3. The target Vault cluster is configured as a secondary using the token and address of the primary.


4. A list of allowed mounts is defined via mount filters on the primary Vault, ensuring only specific paths are eligible for replication.


5. The secondary Vault begins replicating only the allowed mounts.


6. Once the data is fully synced, the secondary can optionally be promoted to operate independently as a standalone Vault cluster.




---

Benefits of This Approach

Granular migration: Only the required teams or applications are migrated.

Minimal disruption: Both Vault clusters remain operational during the migration.

Scalable: Multiple teams or business units can be migrated in phases.

Secure and supported: Uses built-in Vault Enterprise capabilities, with full support from HashiCorp.



---

Post-Migration Actions (Optional)

After verification and validation, the secondary Vault can be promoted to an independent cluster.

Applications can be pointed to the new Vault endpoint.

Old data or access on the original cluster can be retired in a controlled manner.



---

Conclusion

Vault Enterprise’s Performance Replication with mount filtering offers a secure, scalable, and operationally efficient way to migrate selected portions of Vault data to a new cluster. This approach avoids the risks and limitations of manual scripting or Terraform-based workarounds and ensures data consistency and compliance throughout the migration process.

Vault Migration Plan: Non-Prod Data to Dedicated Vault Cluster


---

Overview

This document outlines the strategy to migrate non-production secrets, auth methods, and groups from the existing shared Vault Enterprise cluster (prod + non-prod) to a new, dedicated non-prod Vault cluster with a separate URL.


---

Goals

Isolate non-prod workloads from the current production Vault cluster.

Ensure secure and seamless migration with minimal disruption.

Maintain separate operational, auditing, and security boundaries.



---

Migration Strategy

We will use Vault Enterprise Performance Replication with mount filters to replicate only the required non-prod paths and authentication configurations to the new cluster.


---

What Will Be Migrated


---

What Will NOT Be Migrated


---

Migration Phases

Phase 1: Preparation

[ ] Provision a new Vault Enterprise cluster (non-prod) with separate URL

[ ] Ensure version and plugin parity with the existing cluster

[ ] Enable Performance Replication on the existing (prod) Vault if not already enabled



---

Phase 2: Connect the New Cluster as a Secondary

[ ] Generate a secondary token on the existing Vault

[ ] Connect the new Vault as a secondary using that token



---

Phase 3: Apply Mount Filters

[ ] Create a file mounts.txt listing allowed paths (example below)

[ ] Use a script to configure mount filters via the Vault API


Example mounts.txt:

kv/nonprod/*
secret/devops/*
transit/dev-team/*
auth/ldap-nonprod


---

Phase 4: Validation

[ ] Validate replicated secrets and mount structure

[ ] Validate LDAP login and group memberships

[ ] Validate application connectivity using test workloads



---

Phase 5: Promotion

[ ] Promote the non-prod Vault secondary to standalone

[ ] Break replication link from prod

[ ] Enable local root token access or identity login

[ ] Configure audit log sinks, storage backends, and alerting



---

Phase 6: Cutover

[ ] Update all non-prod app configurations to point to the new Vault URL

[ ] Notify impacted teams

[ ] Retire or disable non-prod mounts on the prod Vault (optional)



---

Benefits of This Approach


---

Why Not Terraform?

Terraform is not suitable for Vault data migration because:

It cannot extract existing secrets or dynamic data

It does not support replication or live data sync

Terraform’s state files may expose sensitive data

It cannot replicate identity groups, leases, or token metadata


Vault Enterprise Performance Replication is the only supported, secure, and scalable method for migrating Vault data between clusters.


---

Post-Migration Tasks

[ ] Review and align non-prod policies

[ ] Enable audit logging and alerting

[ ] Set up backup schedules

[ ] Document new Vault endpoints and access methods
