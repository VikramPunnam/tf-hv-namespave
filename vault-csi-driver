The Vault CSI driver for OpenShift is used to securely inject secrets from HashiCorp Vault into OpenShift pods. It helps applications access secrets dynamically without hardcoding them or requiring external authentication logic. Here are some key use cases for deploying and using the Vault CSI driver in OpenShift:


---

1. Injecting Secrets into Pods as Volumes

The Vault CSI driver allows OpenShift applications to securely mount secrets from HashiCorp Vault as ephemeral volumes.

This is useful for applications that require credentials, API keys, certificates, or other sensitive data without embedding them in the container image or environment variables.


2. Dynamic Secret Rotation

Vault supports dynamic secrets, meaning credentials (e.g., database credentials, cloud IAM tokens) can be generated and rotated automatically.

The CSI driver ensures that applications always use up-to-date secrets without requiring restarts.


3. Database Credentials Management

Using Vault's database secrets engine, the CSI driver can generate short-lived database credentials for PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.

This enhances security by preventing long-lived credentials and reducing attack surfaces.


4. TLS Certificates Injection

The CSI driver can be used to fetch and mount TLS certificates from Vaultâ€™s PKI secrets engine, ensuring secure communication between services.

This is particularly useful for mutual TLS (mTLS) configurations within OpenShift clusters.


5. Kubernetes Service Account Authentication

Applications in OpenShift can authenticate to Vault using Kubernetes Service Account Token Authentication, eliminating the need for static credentials.

This works by mapping OpenShift service accounts to Vault roles.


6. Automating Secret Delivery for CI/CD Pipelines

OpenShift-based CI/CD pipelines (e.g., using Tekton or ArgoCD) can mount secrets dynamically from Vault during build or deployment stages.

This ensures that secrets are provided at runtime without being stored in Git repositories.


7. Secure API Key Management

Applications needing access to external APIs (e.g., AWS, GCP, third-party services) can securely retrieve API keys from Vault via the CSI driver.

Vault can dynamically generate and revoke these API keys as needed.


8. Multi-Tenant Secret Isolation

OpenShift clusters often run multi-tenant workloads. The Vault CSI driver ensures secrets are scoped per namespace and per role, preventing unauthorized access.


9. Improving Compliance & Auditing

Vault provides audit logging for all secret accesses.

This helps organizations comply with security regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS) by tracking who accessed which secrets and when.

Implementation Steps

1. Deploy HashiCorp Vault in OpenShift (or use an external Vault instance).


2. Configure Kubernetes Authentication in Vault.


3. Install the Vault CSI Driver in OpenShift via an Operator or Helm.


4. Create Kubernetes SecretsProviderClass to define how secrets should be fetched.


5. Mount Vault secrets in OpenShift Pods as ephemeral volumes.
