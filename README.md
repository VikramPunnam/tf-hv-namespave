| Use Case | Description |                                                                                
| --- | --- |
| Vault Installation |	| Automate the installation of HashiCorp Vault on Linux servers using Ansible. This includes downloading and installing Vault via package managers or direct binaries and ensuring the Vault service is running.|
| Vault Configuration |	| Automate the configuration of the Vault server through Ansible, including setting up listeners, storage backends (e.g., Raft), seal configurations, and authentication settings (e.g., TLS, API).|
| High Availability (HA) Setup | Automate the setup of a Vault HA cluster with a shared storage backend (e.g., Consul). Ansible ensures proper node configuration for leader election, data replication, and high availability. |
| Cluster Initialization | Automate the initialization of Vault clusters using Ansible, which sets up the root token, enables the seal/unseal mechanism, and configures initial cluster settings. |
| Join Servers to Cluster | Automate the process of adding new Vault nodes to an existing Vault cluster. Ansible configures the new node to join the cluster, syncs data and ensures consistency. |
| Leader Election Management | Automate the management of leader election in the Vault cluster, ensuring the active leader is elected and in case of failure, another node is automatically promoted to leader. |
| Enable/Disable Vault Features | Automate enabling or disabling Vault server features, such as authentication methods (LDAP, AppRole) and secrets engines (KV, databases), using Ansible to ensure uniformity across all nodes. |
| Enable/Disable Audit Devices | Automate the enabling or disabling of Vault audit devices for logging operations (e.g., Syslog, file-based logging). Ansible ensures audit devices are consistently configured across nodes. |
| Backup Vault Data | Automate regular Vault data backups using Ansible, including the configuration and storage backend. Backup operations can be scheduled, ensuring Vault data is available for disaster recovery. |
| Restore Vault Data | Automate the restore process of Vault data from backups. Ansible ensures that data from backups can be restored on any Vault node after a failure or disaster recovery scenario. |
| Vault Upgrade Management | Automate the upgrade process of Vault servers. Ansible ensures that Vault is upgraded to the latest stable version with proper backup and rollback procedures to minimize disruption. |
| Health Check Automation | Automate periodic health checks on Vault servers using the Vault health API (/v1/sys/health). Ansible can trigger alerts when the Vault server fails the health check, ensuring early issue detection. |
| Metrics Collection for Monitoring | Automate the collection of Vault server metrics using Ansible and integrate them with monitoring systems (e.g., Grafana) for tracking performance and operational health. |
| Failover Automation | Automate failover mechanisms in case a Vault node fails. Ansible ensures that a new leader is elected, and failover operations occur seamlessly, ensuring high availability. |
| Cluster Configuration Sync |	
| Disaster Recovery Setup | Automate the disaster recovery setup for Vault, including secondary clusters, replication, and backup configurations. Ansible helps ensure that Vault can be restored to a working state in the event of a disaster. |
| Token Management (Server-Level) | Automate the creation, management, and revocation of tokens used for server-to-server communication within the Vault cluster, ensuring secure and controlled access. |
| Vault Auto-Unseal with Venafi Certs and HSM | Automate Vault's auto-unseal process using Venafi certificates for authentication and an HSM for key management. Ansible retrieves certificates from Venafi using its API, configures HSM to store keys securely, and updates the Vault configuration for auto-unsealing. After the configuration, Vault can automatically unseal itself using certificates stored in Venafi and cryptographic keys from the HSM during startup, eliminating the need for manual unsealing. |
| PR/DR (Primary/Recovery) Configuration | Automate the Primary/Recovery (PR/DR) configuration for Vault clusters. This involves setting up a primary Vault cluster and a recovery Vault cluster to handle disaster recovery. Ansible automates the replication of data, secrets, and configuration between the primary and recovery clusters. In the event of a failure or disaster, the recovery cluster takes over as the primary Vault instance, ensuring continued operation and minimal downtime. Ansible also handles failover and synchronization, ensuring a smooth transition between clusters. |
| Vault Log Rotation Configuration | Automate the configuration of log rotation for Vault logs to manage log file sizes and prevent excessive disk usage. Ansible can be used to configure logrotate or other log management tools, ensuring logs are rotated, archived, and deleted according to specified retention policies. This includes setting up configuration files for rotating logs based on size or time, ensuring that old logs are compressed and stored safely, and that system performance is not affected by excessive log accumulation. |
