Subject: Confirmation Required: Rotating Root Credentials in Azure Secret Engine Using Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope you’re doing well.

I am reaching out to discuss the feasibility of rotating root credentials in Azure Secret Engine (HashiCorp Vault) using the Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy permission instead of the broader Application.ReadWrite.All. This email outlines the problem statement, the proposed solution, relevant official documentation, and the need for thorough testing to confirm its effectiveness.

Problem Statement

In Azure Secret Engine (HashiCorp Vault), rotating root credentials for a configured Service Principal (SPN) is an essential security measure. This operation requires Microsoft Graph API permissions to modify Azure AD applications.

By default, Application.ReadWrite.All is often used because it grants full administrative access over all applications in the directory. However, this level of access introduces security risks, as it is broader than necessary.

The goal is to determine whether Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy—which restricts modifications to applications that the managing SPN already owns—can be used instead.


---

Proposed Solution

Understanding Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy

This permission allows an SPN to modify only the applications it owns in Azure AD.

It does not allow modifications to applications the SPN does not own, unlike Application.ReadWrite.All, which provides unrestricted directory-wide access.

Using Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy follows least-privilege security principles, reducing risks associated with excessive permissions.


When Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy Works for Root Credential Rotation

1. For Dynamically Created SPNs (✅ Expected to Work)

If Vault dynamically creates and manages SPNs, the managing SPN is automatically assigned as the owner of these applications.

Since Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy allows managing owned applications, root credential rotation should work as expected.



2. For Pre-Existing SPNs (⚠️ Requires Ownership Assignment)

If Vault needs to rotate credentials for an existing SPN, the managing SPN must already be an owner of that SPN.

If the managing SPN is not an owner, Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy will not work.

To use Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy, the managing SPN must first be manually assigned as an owner of the target SPN.

If ownership cannot be assigned, Application.ReadWrite.All would still be required.




Key Considerations

This method ensures secure and restricted credential management.

It prevents granting unnecessary permissions beyond the applications the managing SPN owns.

However, there is no specific official documentation confirming this exact use case. Based on the permission’s definition, it is expected to work, but thorough testing is required before full implementation.

Next Steps & Required Confirmation

Thorough testing is required to confirm whether Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy successfully allows root credential rotation.

Please verify whether Vault is managing dynamically created SPNs or pre-existing ones.

If dealing with pre-existing SPNs, check whether the managing SPN is already an owner or if ownership needs to be assigned.

If ownership assignment is required, we should test whether manually adding ownership allows credential rotation.

If testing confirms that Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy is sufficient, we can proceed with this least-privileged approach. Otherwise, Application.ReadWrite.All will still be required.


Looking forward to your feedback and test results.
