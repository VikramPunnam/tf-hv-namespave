Subject: Possible Approach for Rotating Root Credentials in Azure Secret Engine Using Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope you’re doing well.

Below is a possible approach for rotating root credentials in Azure Secret Engine (HashiCorp Vault) using the Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy permission instead of the broader Application.ReadWrite.All.

Possible Approach

The Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy permission allows an SPN to modify only the applications it owns in Azure AD. This makes it a more restrictive and secure alternative to Application.ReadWrite.All, which provides full directory-wide access.

When It Can Work for Root Credential Rotation:

1. For Dynamically Created SPNs (✅ Possible)

If Vault dynamically creates and manages SPNs, the managing SPN is automatically assigned as the owner of these applications.

Since Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy allows modifications to owned applications, root credential rotation should be possible in this scenario.



2. For Pre-Existing SPNs (⚠️ Ownership Required)

If the SPN whose credentials need rotation was pre-created, the managing SPN must already be an owner of the target SPN.

If the managing SPN is not an owner, Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy will not work, and either:

Ownership must be manually assigned to the managing SPN, or

Application.ReadWrite.All would still be required.





Security & Compliance Benefits

Minimizes privilege exposure by limiting access to only owned applications.

Follows least-privilege security principles, reducing security risks.

Prevents unnecessary administrative access to unrelated applications.
