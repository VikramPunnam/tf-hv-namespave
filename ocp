Here’s a simple, user-friendly version of the Vault Onboarding Process, presented in one box for easy inclusion in Confluence or similar internal docs. It’s written from the end-user’s perspective, with both current and future-state expectations clearly outlined.

🛠️ Vault Onboarding Process

To use Vault for secret injection in your application:

1. Contact the Vault Team
Reach out with your app details (namespace, service account, secret path, etc.).


2. Manual Setup (Current Process)
The Vault team will manually:

Create a Vault role linked to your Kubernetes service account

Define a Vault policy allowing access to your secret path

Ensure proper authentication method (e.g., JWT) is enabled for your namespace

Share the required deployment annotations with you



3. Future Automation (Planned Enhancement)
Eventually, this process will be fully automated.
Once your app is onboarded to OCP via ELMA or EPL pipelines:

Vault resources (roles, policies, paths) will be auto-provisioned

No manual intervention from the Vault team will be needed

You can directly use Vault Injector by just adding the correct annotations




> 🔄 Until automation is live, please follow the manual process to ensure Vault access is configured correctly.
