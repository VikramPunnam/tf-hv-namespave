Certainly, here's a more formal and technically precise version:

Dear Team,

Kim, Herdeep, and I participated in the troubleshooting session to analyze the reported issue. Below are our observations:

The generation of dynamic Service Principal Name (SPN) credentials via the Vault Azure Secrets Engine is currently taking in excess of 90 seconds. A review of the Vault server logs did not reveal any anomalies or latency indicators that would suggest the delay originates from Vault itself. This points to a potential latency or throttling issue on the Microsoft Azure side.

At this stage, the following remediation options are under consideration:

Extending the timeout threshold in the Python script responsible for credential validation.

Revisiting the current group-based role assignment strategy, which may be contributing to the observed latency.

Let me know if you'd like to tailor this for a specific audience or stakeholder.
