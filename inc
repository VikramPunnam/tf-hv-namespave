Here is a refined version of your query, formatted for formal submission to the HashiCorp vendor:


---

We would like to request clarification regarding the Vault container images published by HashiCorp on different registries. Specifically, we are seeking to understand whether the images available on Docker Hub (docker.io/hashicorp/vault) and the Red Hat Container Catalog (registry.redhat.io) are identical in all aspects. This includes image content, functionality, security hardening, update and patch cycles, and versioning. Furthermore, we would appreciate your guidance on whether using the image from Docker Hub introduces any differences or limitations compared to the image from the Red Hat registry, particularly in terms of production readiness, enterprise support, or adherence to recommended best practices.
